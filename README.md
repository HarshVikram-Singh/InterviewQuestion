This is the machine coding Round challenge.

Steps to run the code:
1. Clone the repositary
2. Run npm i command to install the dependencies.
3. To run the project you have to type npm run dev.

ThoughtProcess:
Overall it is good experience while developing it the major challenge that i had is to keypress moment and show the images on the middle of the screen.but ywah the logic part that i implemented is easy to understand.
